    <p><b>Glass </b>is a solid material made from natural raw materials that are melted and cooled:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Sand: The main component of glass, sand is made of quartz crystals, which are made of silicon dioxide, also known as silica.</b> </li>
        
        <li><i>Soda ash: A component of commercial glass.</i> </li>
        
        <li><mark>Limestone: A component of commercial glass. </mark></li>
       
        <li><u>Cullet: Recycled glass pieces that are added to commercial glass. </u></li>

    To make <b>glass,</b> these materials are melted in a furnace at temperatures of around <b>3,090°F (1,700°C).</b> The resulting liquid is then cooled quickly to prevent crystals from forming. 
    Glass is an inorganic material that is usually transparent or translucent. It's hard and brittle, and it's resistant to the elements. <mark style="background-color: blueviolet; color: white">However, glass can break if it contains impurities from dust or moisture in the air.</mark> These impurities can cause microscopic fractures and stress in the glass, which can lead to breakage when pressure is applied. 
    Glass can also be created naturally when sand or rocks rich in silica are heated to high temperatures and then cooled quickly. <i>For example, obsidian, or volcanic glass, is formed when molten rock cools quickly.</i></p>
